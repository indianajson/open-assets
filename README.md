<h2> Known Limitations</h2>
- <b>Background preview</b> does not accurately reflect the movement speed of the background as it will appear in-game with the same velocity values. The renderer will need to be refactored in order to more accurately display background movement. <br>
- <b>Tile/Object preview</b> sometimes shows the animation for a different tile if scrolling too fast. This is resolved by moving down or up one row and back again.
